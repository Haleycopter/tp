### Project: Big Brother

Big Brother is a desktop address book application used for managing employee details by HR Staff of a startup. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: TODO: Added search Tag functionality for contacts.
  * What it does: allows the user to use the find command to search for tags for each contact.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can interact with tags and find specific contacts quicker.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

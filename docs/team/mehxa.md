### Project: Big Brother

Big Brother is a desktop address book application for HR managers in startups to maintain and update employee details. It is optimised for use via a CLI, but also has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Revamped the in-app help feature.
  * What it does: displays the format and usage of all commands, or the command specified to the user.
  * Justification: This feature improves user experience significantly because a user can now learn about all valid commands, or the command specified, without having to navigate to a separate webpage.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future minimally. The implementation was not too challenging, but tedious as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*
